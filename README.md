Self Watering Irrigation System

Description: This item has been designed to be used as a self-watering system that checks different factors of the soils health and waters the plants in the particular areas accordingly. These factors are soil health, pH and temperature. The hubs which consist of the hardware which manage this system can be connected remotely via a central app which communicates information about the zones the hubs are placed in. 

Apparatus:
Hub                                                                                                         
  - Arduino wifi                                                                                     
  - Battery (9v) *not included                                 
  - pH sensor                                                 
  - Temperature sensor                                
  - Soil sensor
  - wires

Hose 
  - 2m hose
  - Attachment to extend
  - Solenoid valve

App: The purpose of the app is to give the user access to multiple hubs which they would place in different sectors of their backyard. This would allow the user to name the individual sectors (such as tomatos, roses, etc). Each of these individual sectors would also provide the user information about the soils health, pH and temperature. The app could also be multipurpose and be used as a 

Implementation:
1) Place battery in hub / Charge hub
2) Place hub in middle of desired area of soil patch
3) Spread hose in desired area of watering
4) Attach the hose to the tap and ensure the tap is on
5) Connect the hub to the app via wifi

Cost ≈ $60 (could be reduced massively in large scale)
Selling price ≈ $150

Selling points:
- Easy to use
- Simple system
- Light weight and ergonomic
- Multiple connectivities of hubs
- Provides lots of data on soil
- Can be controlled remotely
